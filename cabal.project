-- In order to build hackage-cli w/ an unreleased Cabal-2.x (NB: this builds fine w/ GHC 8.2.1 and its bundled Cabal-2.0):
--  1. `cabal get -s Cabal`
--  2. uncomment the 2 lines below (the constraints-line is a hack to avoid `setup`-components picking up the local Cabal package)

-- packages: Cabal/Cabal
-- constraints: setup.Cabal < 2
